3. [Halver](https://repl.it/teacher/assignments/3842248)
    * Write a method which takes an argument of an `Integer` and returns half of the `Integer` value as a `Double`.
2. [Integer Adder](https://repl.it/teacher/assignments/3842241)
    * Write a method which takes an argument of two `Integer`s, (`value1` and `value2`) and returns the sum of `value1` and `value2`.
2. [Middle Character Grabber](https://repl.it/teacher/assignments/3842551)
    * Write a method which takes an argument of a `String` and returns the `Character` at the _middle index_.

6. [Encryper](https://repl.it/teacher/assignments/3841397)
    * Write a method which takes an argument of `String` and _encrypts_ each `Character` of the `String` by offsetting each `Character` by a value of `4`.
        * For example        
        ```python
            f("a") => d
            f("b") => e
            f("abce") => defg
            f("w") => a
            f("wx") => za
            f("wxyz") => zabc
        ```
