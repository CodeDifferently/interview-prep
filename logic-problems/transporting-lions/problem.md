# Lion Tamer Transport Problem
* Identify a process to transport 3 pairs of lion and lion-tamers across a river in a 2-person boat.
* Be mindful of the following details:
    * if a lion-tamer is outnumbered by lions within the immediate vicinity, the lions will eat the lion tamer.
    * a lion will can only be controlled (transported) by its respective tamer
    * a lion-tamer can direct a lion from the boat without leaving the boat
